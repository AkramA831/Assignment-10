The test was successfully executed with a Passed status

This test case successfully demonstrates that the application can navigate to the "Hello World" feature and retrieve the target text. This validation is important to ensure that the UI displays as intended and that its text elements are detectable by the automation engine.

## Test Case 2: Tap 10 Times on "Bouncing Balls" Animation

The test was successfully executed with a Passed status

This test case tests the animation response of the "Bouncing Balls" feature after being tapped 10 times. Although no visual validation of the bouncing effect was performed, the successful taps and the absence of errors indicate that the application did not crash or freeze during the interaction. This is important for demonstrating the application's stability under repeated user interactions.
